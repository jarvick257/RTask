# RTask

RTask is a Home Assistant plugin that helps you to keep track of all the reoccuring tasks around your home.

The issue with a lot of things is that you need to do them regularly, but keeping track of when you did something last can be quite hard.
Some examples:
- did I water the plant this week?
- I really should descale the washing machine twice a year...
- Did I clean the cat's toilet today? Did my wife?

With RTask, you can simply create a new item for every task you want to do regularly.
Provide a name, a minimum time and a maximum time and let HomeAssistant handle the rest:
- I want to water the plant every 5 to 7 days
- I want do descale the washing machine every 6 or 7 months
- I should check the cat's toilet every 12hours, definitely once a day!

You can then create a dashboard in homeassistant and see in a glance what tasks should be done and which you don't have to worry about.
