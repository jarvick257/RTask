# RTask - Recurring Task Tracker

**RTask** is a Home Assistant custom integration that helps you track and manage recurring household tasks with flexible time windows and persistent completion tracking.

## Features

✅ **Flexible scheduling** - Time windows instead of rigid schedules  
✅ **Accidental-completion protection** - Long-press prevents misclicks  
✅ **Multiple time units** - Configure in hours or days  
✅ **Mark as Done** - Integrate with smart home devices to automatically mark tasks complete  
✅ **Phone notifications** - Get notified when tasks become due or overdue  
✅ **Visual dashboard** - See all tasks and their urgency at a glance  
✅ **Priority sorting** - Overdue tasks automatically appear first  

## Perfect for tasks like:
- 🪴 **Watering plants** (every 3-5 days, depending on weather)
- 🧽 **Cleaning appliances** (descale coffee machine every 2-3 months)  
- 🐱 **Pet care** (clean litter box every 12-24 hours)
- 🏠 **Home maintenance** (change air filter every 3-6 months)
- 🧹 **Household chores** (vacuum stairs weekly, but some flexibility is fine)
